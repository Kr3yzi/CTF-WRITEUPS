## Solution 

So, my first guess was directly try and guess a few common hidden endpoint for a ctf challenge until i find there's flag.txt

This is where i realise that i misslook they has given me a hint: 
**On second thoughts I should have probably called this challenge "Nz Gjstu DUG"** 
which Nz Gjstu DUG = My First CTF decrypted in rot1. I figured it could be something related with rot encrypted and with the flag.txt

So i dedcided to encrypt the flag.txt in rot1 too and use it as the webapp endpoint.
